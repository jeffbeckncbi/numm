# numm

This is preliminary work for the NISO Uber Meta Model.

There are two directories here: models and xslt

Currently numm/models contains three fies:
  * jats1.xml - an xml representation of the numm properties of JATS 1.1d3.
  * bits1.xml - an xml representation of the numm properties of BITS 1.0.
  * bits1-test.xml - a copy of bits1.xml with changes that will fail the compatibility tests.
